<h3 align="center">Web-based PostgreSQL data explorer with AI, workflow builder, integration, ... and more are being added!</h3>

![Demo screenshot](./public/demo1.png)

Just built a local-first toolbox for my data analysis needs, [PGlite](https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite)-powered. AI, workflow builder, and whatever buzzwords you can think get thrown in there. It's a work in progress, but some use cases are covered already. Some of my use cases to give you an idea of what you can do with it:

- I have some CSV and JSON files. I want to Ctrl+V them into Postgres and ask the o mighty LLM to "give me the top 5 most active accounts per group, JSON-aggregated." It should know the schema (but not the dataâ€”for security reasons) and provide a runnable SQL query. I then run it, modify it, and ask the AI to modify it for me for more complex cases.

- I want to interact with my [DBML](https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/home) schema I wrote some time ago, and store my reusable queries somewhere. Moreover, I have multiple types of data sources and being able to combine them to perform joins and aggregations sounds like a good idea.

- (TODO) I want to add "Codepen/JSFiddle snippets but for SQL queries" in my blogs to archive some cool SQL patterns and benchmarks (select top 1 per group, materialized CTE/subquery vs. lateral join performance of different cardinalities)

Try it out at [pg-explore.vercel.app](https://pg-explore.vercel.app). It will cache the data in your browser (PWA), and then you can use it offline the next time you visit the site. Or host it locally in the section below!

You can keep me motivated just by using this site or starring this repo. Motivation powers open-source development, as always!

## Development

(Optional) You can set up the env for the default AI integration (OpenAI compatible API). Or just configure it later in the app settings (per browser config).
```
VITE_AI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
VITE_AI_BASE_URL=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai
VITE_AI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash
```

### To start the site

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

### Build distribution

```bash
npx tsc -b && pnpm build
```

## TODO backlog :D
Suggest any ideas, report bugs - it helps!

  - [x] Parse + autocompletion (with Lezer grammar)
  - [x] Lint
- [ ] Table data editor (tab #6) (with Handsontable (it's so good for Excel-like capability) / open-source alt in the future?)
  - [ ] Import CSV
  - [ ] Import JSON
  - [ ] Data type config
    - [ ] Data type
    - [ ] Unique/null/Autoincrement
  - [ ] Auto detect column type

### Will do next
- [ ] Dark mode

- [ ] Tables & relationship visualization
  - [ ] Table
    - [ ] Name
    - [ ] Datatype
    - [ ] Modifiers
  - [ ] Relationship
  - [ ] Auto-layout

### In consideration
- [ ] Export embeddable iframes
- [ ] View query result as charts
- [ ] Import/Export workflow and files
- [ ] Import/Export database dump
- [ ] REPL console (supporting \d commands, pg_dump,...)
- [ ] Populate random data workflow step (implement with Faker.js?)
- [ ] More AI (actually, I'm not too hyped for this)
  - Copilot/Cursor-like suggestion
  - Inline suggestion
- [ ] Proper unit tests (pardon my overconfidence in code -_-)
