<h3 align="center">Web PostgreSQL data explorer with AI, extensions, workflow builder, visualizer, integration,... and God knows what I will add in the future??</h3>

![Demo screenshot](./public/demo1.png)

"Most database clients are so unintuitive, except those integrated in Jetbrains' apps, which I already use daily." But even with the most advanced clients, it still can't help my unreasonably specific use cases. 

Then I found [PGlite](https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite), which is a lightweight Postgres server that can run in a browser. "Why don't I create my own Postgres toolbox that can run anywhere to ease my gridmaxxing at work?", I wondered. And so began this repoâ€”purely to support my use-case driven needs.

- I have CSV, JSON data of unknown structure. I want to dump all of them into Postgres and use some LLM to "give me the top 5 most active accounts per group, JSON-aggregated." It should know the schema (but not the data, unless specified) and provide a runnable SQL query. I then run it, modify it, and ask the AI to modify it for me for more complex cases.

- The other time, I want to create the tables with my DBML schema I wrote some time ago, and also I want to store my reusable queries in the browser. Why not make it work as a workflow/node-chain and language agnostic while I'm at it?

Try it out at [pg-explore.vercel.app](https://pg-explore.vercel.app). It will download to your browser once, and then you can use it offline the next time you visit the site (PWA). Or host it locally in the section below!

The more people use it, or star this repo, the more I am motivated to develop more! Gotta love those steadily increasing numbers :)

- [ ] Populate random data step (implement with Faker.js)

## Development

(Optional) You can setup some env for default AI integration (OpenAI compatible API). Or just configure later in the app settings (per browser config).
