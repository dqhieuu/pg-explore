<h3 align="center">PostgreSQL data explorer that lives in your browser.</h3>

![Demo screenshot](./public/demo1.png)

- Ever wanted to test out a SQL query without having to set up a database?  
- Have a colossal database schema, and feel like AI (maybe your locally hosted one) can help you to write SQL queries? 
- Or just want to utilize the versatility of PostgreSQL to analyze your sensitive JSON/CSV files, but importing files is a big hassle? 

pgExplore is here to help you with that! pgExplore is a Progressive Web App (PWA) Postgres explorer and server that runs offline in your browser (works without Internet connection). Completely free and open-source. Powered by [PGlite](https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite) and my desire to build a capable and user-friendly SQL toolbox ðŸ˜ƒ

Try it out at [pg-explore.vercel.app](https://pg-explore.vercel.app).

## Features

- [x] Create and manage Postgres databases that persist in your browser
- [x] Add table schema & data files (SQL, DBML, JSON,...) to build your query workflow
- [x] Configurable AI assistant fed with your database schema to help you write SQL queries
